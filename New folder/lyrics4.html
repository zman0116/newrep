Land is the detachment of a resource from nature, an aspect
of the productive potential of nature rendered abstract,
in the form of property. Capital is the detachment of a resource
from land, an aspect of the productive potential of
land rendered abstract in the form of property. Information
is the detachment of a resource from capital already detached
from land. It is the double of a double. It is a further
process of abstraction beyond capital, but one that yet again
produces its separate existence in the form of property.<a href="Lyrics5.html">next</a>
