Invention is the mother of necessity. While all states depend
on abstraction for the production of their wealth and
power, the ruling class of any given state has an uneasy relationship
to the production of abstraction in new forms. The
ruling class seeks always to control innovation and turn it to
its own ends, depriving the hacker of control of her or his
creation, and thereby denying the world as a whole the right
to manage its own development.
