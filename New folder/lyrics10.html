As private property advances from land to capital to information,
property itself becomes more abstract. Capital as
property frees land from its spatial fixity. Information as
property frees capital from its fixity in a particular object.
This abstraction of property makes property itself something
amenable to accelerated innovation—and conflict.
Class conflict fragments, but creeps into any and every relation
that becomes a relation of property. The property
question, the basis of class, becomes the question asked
everywhere, of everything. If “class” appears absent to the
apologists of our time, it is not because it has become just
another in a series of antagonisms and articulations, but on
the contrary because it has become the structuring principle
of the vectoral plane which organizes the play of identities
as differences
