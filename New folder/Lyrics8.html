As peasants become farmers through the appropriation of
their land, they still retain some autonomy over the disposition
of their working time. Workers, even though they do
not own capital, and must work according to the clock
and its merciless time, could at least struggle to reduce the
working day and release free time from labor. Information
circulated within working class culture as a public property
belonging to all. But when information in turn becomes
a form of private property, workers are dispossessed of it,
and must buy their own culture back from its owners, the
vectoralist class. The farmer becomes a worker, and the
worker, a slave. The whole world becomes subject to the extraction
of a surplus from the producing classes that is controlled
by the ruling classes, who use it merely to reproduce
and expand this matrix of exploitation. Time itself becomes
a commodified experience.
